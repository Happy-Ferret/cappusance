Cappusance is a powerful textual GUI builder based on GNUstep Renaissance.
Cappusance comes with strong autolayout capabilities.
See <http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/> for the original GNUstep Renaissance documentation.
See Slider<->TextField example on <http://aug-fancy.ukl.uni-freiburg.de/NewApplication/>

Cappusance comes along with a RESTful ORM to allow painless database-to-GUI mapping in the spirit of EOF/WebObjects.
You can also use KVO bindings and outlets without using it.


usage:
@import <Renaissance/Renaissance.j>
[...]
- (void) applicationDidFinishLaunching:(CPNotification)aNotification
{	store=[[FSStore alloc] initWithBaseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]; // this instance variable is accessed from within the markup file via KVC
	[CPBundle loadRessourceNamed: "gui.gsmarkup" owner:self];  //gui.gsmarkup is loaded from the Ressources folder
}
// no further coding requred for "CRUD" functionality
gui.gsmarkup is on the wiki and has to be placed in Ressources folder
