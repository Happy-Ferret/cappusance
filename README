Cappusance is a powerful textual GUI builder based on GNUstep Renaissance.
Cappusance comes with strong autolayout capabilities.
See <http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/> for the original GNUstep Renaissance documentation.
See Slider<->TextField example on <http://aug-fancy.ukl.uni-freiburg.de/NewApplication/>

Cappusance ships with a RESTful ORM to allow painless database-to-GUI mapping in the spirit of EOF/WebObjects.
Cappusance also runs without any backend. Here, you can connect bindings and outlets directly to your instance variables and objects (through KVC).


usage:
@import <Renaissance/Renaissance.j>
[...]
- (void) applicationDidFinishLaunching:(CPNotification)aNotification
{
// this instance variable is accessed from within the markup file via KVC
	store=[[FSStore alloc] initWithBaseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]; 
  //gui.gsmarkup is loaded from the Ressources folder
	[CPBundle loadRessourceNamed: "gui.gsmarkup" owner:self];
}
// no further coding requred for "CRUD" functionality
gui.gsmarkup is on the wiki
