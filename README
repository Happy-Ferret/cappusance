Cappusance is a powerful textual GUI builder for cappuccino based on GNUstep Renaissance.
Cappusance i.e. features strong autolayout capabilities.
See <http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/> for the original GNUstep Renaissance documentation.

Cappusance has a light RESTful ORM builtin for painless database-to-GUI mapping in the spirit of EOF/WebObjects.
Cappusance is also useful without any backend. Here, you can connect bindings and outlets directly to your instance variables and objects.
See Slider<->TextField example on <http://aug-fancy.ukl.uni-freiburg.de/NewApplication/>

Example usage with backend:
@import <Renaissance/Renaissance.j>
[...]
- (void) applicationDidFinishLaunching:(CPNotification)aNotification
{
// this instance variable is accessed from within the markup file (via owner:self below)
	store=[[FSStore alloc] initWithBaseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]; 
// gui.gsmarkup is loaded from the Ressources folder
	[CPBundle loadRessourceNamed: "gui.gsmarkup" owner:self];
}
// no further coding requred for "CRUD" functionality
gui.gsmarkup is on the wiki
